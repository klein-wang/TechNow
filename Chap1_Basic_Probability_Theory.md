Chapter 1: Basic Probability Theory
1.1 Probability spaces
Goal: The goal of probability theory is to build a mathematical framework for representing and analyzing uncertain phenomena.

Probability Space
A probability space is a mathematical structure that characterizes an experiment. It consists of three elements:

Sample space (Ω): The sample space contains all possible outcomes of the experiment. It represents the set of all possible results.

Set of events (F): The set of events is a collection of subsets of the sample space. These subsets represent sets of outcomes or certain conditions that we are interested in. The set of events must satisfy the properties of a σ-algebra.

Probability measure (P): The probability measure assigns probabilities to the events in the set F. It is a function that maps events to real numbers and satisfies certain properties.

Discrete and Continuous Sample Spaces
Sample spaces can be categorized as discrete or continuous.

Discrete sample spaces: These sample spaces represent experiments with a countable number of possible outcomes. Examples include the outcomes of a coin toss, the score of a basketball game, or the number of people at a party.

Continuous sample spaces: These sample spaces represent experiments with uncountably infinite outcomes, often modeled using intervals of real numbers (R) or n-dimensional real space (R^n). Continuous sample spaces are used to model time, position, temperature, etc.

Probability theory provides a framework for reasoning about uncertain events by assigning probabilities to specific events of interest. By defining a probability space, we can mathematically analyze and quantify the likelihood of different outcomes or events within an experiment.

Note:

Probability spaces consist of a sample space, a set of events, and a probability measure.
The sample space contains all possible outcomes of the experiment.
The set of events represents subsets of the sample space.
The probability measure assigns probabilities to the events in the set of events.
Sample spaces can be discrete or continuous, depending on the nature of the experiment.
